Neo-Luddism is a movement that challenges the uncritical adoption and development of modern technology. Itâ€™s rooted in concerns that rapid technological progress can lead to unintended social, economic, and environmental consequences. The movement draws its name from the original Luddites, textile workers in the 19th century who protested against machines that threatened their livelihoods.

Eg: Arguing that AI will replace human jobs on a massive scale, leading to widespread unemployment and economic inequality. They may call for halting AI-driven automation in certain sectors to protect workers' livelihoods. [Wiki Link]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism)
