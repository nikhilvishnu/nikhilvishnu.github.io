1. **Advantage & Appeal:** How much better is the new idea compared to the old? Does it offer clear benefits (economic, social, convenience) that resonate with the target audience? The greater the perceived advantage, the faster the adoption.

2. **Compatibility Check:** Does the innovation fit seamlessly with existing values, practices, and experiences? New ideas that clash with established norms will have a tougher time taking root.

3. **Keeping it Simple:** The easier an innovation is to understand and use, the faster it will spread. People are more likely to adopt things that are user-friendly and don't require a steep learning curve.

4. **Trying it Out:** The ability to experiment with an innovation on a small scale reduces user uncertainty. Think free trials, demos, or introductory versions.

5. **Seeing is Believing:** People are more likely to adopt something if they can see the positive outcomes for themselves or others. Visible results act as social proof and fuel positive word-of-mouth.
