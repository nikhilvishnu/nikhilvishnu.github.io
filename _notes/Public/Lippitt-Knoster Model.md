The Lippitt-Knoster Model for Managing Complex Change provides a framework to address challenges when implementing change within an organization. It emphasizes the alignment of five key elements to ensure successful outcomes, highlighting potential pitfalls when any element is missing.

Vision, consensus, skills, incentives, resources, and an action plan are the five key elements, and if any of these is missing, it leads to different outcomes.

| **Vision** | **Consensus** | **Skills** | **Incentives** | **Resources** | **Action Plan** | **Outcome**         |
|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| ✔          | ✔             | ✔          | ✔              | ✔             | ✔               | **Success**         |
| ❌         | ✔             | ✔          | ✔              | ✔             | ✔               | **Confusion**       |
| ✔          | ❌            | ✔          | ✔              | ✔             | ✔               | **Sabotage**        |
| ✔          | ✔             | ❌         | ✔              | ✔             | ✔               | **Anxiety**         |
| ✔          | ✔             | ✔          | ❌             | ✔             | ✔               | **Resistance**      |
| ✔          | ✔             | ✔          | ✔              | ❌            | ✔               | **Frustration**     |
| ✔          | ✔             | ✔          | ✔              | ✔             | ❌              | **False Starts**    |



**Key Components:**
1. Vision: Unclear Vision Creates Confusion
2. Consensus: Absence of Consensus May Lead to Sabotage
3. Skills: Without Skills There Will Be Anxiety
4. Incentives: Lack of Incentives Leads to Resistance
5. Resources: Dearth of Resources Causes Frustration
6. Action Plan: No Plan of Action Hinders Progress


One major change that is happening in organisations now is the implementation of AI workflows. This model will help in managing outcome for this kind of changes.
