Hi, I’m Nikhil Vishnu — a Product Manager, entrepreneur, and mentor passionate about building innovative solutions that drive meaningful impact. With over 13 years of experience in the tech industry, I specialize in creating, launching, and scaling B2B SaaS products that deliver exceptional value to users and businesses alike.

#### My Journey

My career began in engineering, where I honed my technical expertise by developing software and building applications, including **iOS and Mac apps**. Over time, I transitioned into product management, drawn by my passion for creating user-centered solutions and bringing impactful ideas to life.

One of the most transformative chapters of my career was co-founding Voltella, a product development studio where I led a talented team to build cutting-edge apps and platforms. One standout achievement during this time was launching Mobapper, a native app creation platform that secured funding from Times Internet and was featured in prestigious accelerator programs like TLabs and NASSCOM Innotrek.

Today, as a Senior Product Manager at Milestone Internet, I lead cross-functional teams to develop and enhance enterprise-grade solutions, including personalization tools and Customer Data Platforms.

#### Beyond Work
When I’m not immersed in product strategies, you’ll find me mentoring aspiring product managers on platforms like ADPList, sharing insights, and helping others navigate their career paths. I’m also passionate about sustainability and love experimenting with eco-friendly gardening techniques to create a greener tomorrow.
